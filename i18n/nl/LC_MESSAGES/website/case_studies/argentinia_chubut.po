"In our region, Argentinean Patagonia, we have very few references about the "
"application of GIS in High School for the construction of geographical "
"knowledge as a mean to face territorial and environmental issues. The case "
"of the urban green spaces in Rada Tilly coastal town analyzed by QuantumGIS, "
"tends to demonstrate a methodology of an academic exercise that can project, "
"with important reaches, as formative instances related to the geographical "
"reasoning in students of 12th grade of the Abraham Lincoln School. We "
"started by the observation (inventory), digitizing the cadastral blocks and "
"the green areas (tree´s canopy) using Google Earth satellite images. As a "
"conceptual framework, we lectured about cartographic design, satellite "
"images reading and interpretation, and specially, location analysis to "
"contrast the situation (in m2) of the urban green spaces by inhabitant in "
"Rada Villa coastal town, with values suggested by the World Health "
"Organization -WHO- (a  minimum of 9 m2 of green areas, by person, in urban "
"areas)."

"Based in the projection of an average value of 4 inhabitants by cadastral "
"plot, we estimated that the current (2010) urban population Rada Tilly would "
"go up to around 9.600 inhabitants. These people reside in 209 blocks and "
"they represent 157.6 hectares. The average population density would be of 61 "
"inhabitants by hectare. The total inventoried green areas grow up to 150.736 "
"m2 (15 hectares). Reason why we can consider that the green area by "
"inhabitant in the study area is 15.7 m2 (the WHO suggested value is 9m2 of "
"green area by inhabitant). This value proves a very favorable situation, as "
"far as the environmental benefits, that trees offer to the inhabitants in "
"this marine coastal town."

"Although the project was an academic exercise of High School, we deeply "
