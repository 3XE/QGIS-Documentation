"A raster layer consists of one or more raster bands - it is referred to as "
"either single band or multi band raster. One band represents a matrix of "
"values. Usual color image (e.g. aerial photo) is a raster consisting of red,"
" blue and green band. Single band layers typically represent either "
"continuous variables (e.g. elevation) or discrete variables (e.g. land use)."
" In some cases, a raster layer comes with a palette and raster values refer "
"to colors stored in the palette."
