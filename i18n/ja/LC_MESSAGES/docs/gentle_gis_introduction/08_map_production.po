#~ "The scale of a map, is the value of a single unit of distance on the map, "

#~ "example, in words, as a ratio or as a graphical scale bar (see  )."

#~ "fraction (RF)** method, where both the map distance and the ground distance "
#~ "in the real world are given in the same map units, as a ratio. For example, "
#~ "a RF value 1:25,000 means that any distance on the map is 1/25,000*th* of "
#~ "the real distance on the ground (see b ). The value 25,000 in the ratio is "
#~ "called the **scale denominator**. More experienced users often prefer the "
#~ "representative fraction method, because it reduces confusion."

#~ "When a representative fraction expresses a very small ratio, for example "

#~ "scale map**. It is handy to remember that a small scale map covers a **large"
#~ " area**, and a large scale map covers a **small area**!"
