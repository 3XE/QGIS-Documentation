"Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of an "
"algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we need not"
" just a single value for each parameter, but a set of them instead, one for "
"each time the algorithm has to be executed. Values are introduced using a "
"table like the one shown next."
msgstr "Eseguire un processo batch è un'operazione simile ad un'esecuzione singola di un algoritmo. Devono essere definiti i valori dei parametri, ma in questo caso, è necessario definire non solo un singolo valore per ciascunodi essi, ma invece un set di valori, uno per ogni volta che l'algoritmo deve essere eseguito. I valori sono introdotti per mezzo di una tabella del tipo di quella mostrata oltre."
