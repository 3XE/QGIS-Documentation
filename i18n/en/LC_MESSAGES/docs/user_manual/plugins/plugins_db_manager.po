"If connected to a database, the **main** window of the DB Manager offers "
"three tabs. The :guilabel:`Info` tab provides information about the table "
"and its geometry as well as about existing Fields, Constraints and Indexes. "
"It also allows to run Vacuum Analyze and to create a spatial index on a "
"selected table, if not already done. The :guilabel:`Table` tab shows all "
"attributes and the :guilabel:`Preview` tab renders the geometries as "
"preview."

"The DB Manager Plugin is officially part of |qg| core and intends to replace"

"Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can drag layers from the |qg|"
" Browser into the DB Manager and it will import your layer into your spatial"
" database. You can drag and drop tables between spatial databases and they "
