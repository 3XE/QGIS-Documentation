"complex operations that cannot be performed using any of the other elements "

"using the command-line interface, and additional operations such as loops "

"``runalg()`` method, which takes the name of the algorithm to execute as its "

"depending on the requirements of the algorithm. So the first thing you need "
"to know is the name of the algorithm to execute. That is not the name you "
