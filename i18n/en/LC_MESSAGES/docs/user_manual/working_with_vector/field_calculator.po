"The |mActionCalculateField| :sup:`Field Calculator` button in the attribute "
"table allows to perform calculations on basis of existing attribute values "

"If you choose to add a new field, you need to enter a field name, a field "
"type (integer, real or string), the total field width, and the field "
"precision (see figure_attributes_3_). For example, if you choose a field "
"width of 10 and a field precision of 3 it means you have 6 signs before the "
"dot, then the dot and another 3 signs for the precision."
