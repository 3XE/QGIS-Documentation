"Calculates the distance downslope to a stream using the D-infinity flow "
"model. The D-infinity flow model is a multiple flow direction model, because"
" the outflow from each grid cell is proportioned between up to 2 downslope "
"grid cells. As such, the distance from any grid cell to a stream is not "
"uniquely defined. Flow that originates at a particular grid cell may enter "
"the stream at a number of different cells. The statistical method may be "
"selected as the longest, shortest or weighted average of the flow path "
"distance to the stream. Also one of several ways of measuring distance may "
"be selected: the total straight line path (Pythagoras), the horizontal "
"component of the straight line path, the vertical component of the straight "
"line path, or the total surface flow path."

"A grid giving weights (loadings) to be used in the distance calculation. "
"This might be used for example where only flow distance through a buffer is "
"to be calculated. The weight is then 1 in the buffer and 0 outside it. "
"Alternatively the weight may reflect some sort of cost function for travel "
"over the surface, perhaps representing travel time or attenuation of a "
"process. If this input file is not used, the loadings will assumed to be one"
" for each grid cell."

"A flag that determines whether the tool should check for edge contamination."
" This is defined as the possibility that a value may be underestimated due "
"to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted. In the context of "
"Distance Down this occurs when part of a flow path traced downslope from a "
"grid cell leaves the domain without reaching a stream grid cell. With edge "
"contamination checking selected, the algorithm recognizes this and reports "
"no data for the result. This is the desired effect and indicates that values"
" for these grid cells is unknown due to it being dependent on terrain "
"outside of the domain of data available. Edge contamination checking may be "
"overridden in cases where you know this is not an issue or want to evaluate "
"the distance using only the fraction of flow paths that terminate at a "
