"This works in a similar way to evaluation of weighted Contributing area, "
"except that the accumulation is by propagating the weight loadings upslope "
"along the reverse of the flow directions to accumulate the quantity of "
"weight loading downslope from each grid cell. The function also reports the "
"maximum value of the weight loading downslope from each grid cell in the "
"Maximum Downslope grid."

"This function is designed to evaluate and map the hazard due to activities "
"that may have an effect downslope. The example is land management activities"
" that increase runoff. Runoff is sometimes a trigger for landslides or "
"debris flows, so the weight grid here could be taken as a terrain stability "
"map. Then the reverse accumulation provides a measure of the amount of "
"unstable terrain downslope from each grid cell, as an indicator of the "
"danger of activities that may increase runoff, even though there may be no "
"potential for any local impact."
