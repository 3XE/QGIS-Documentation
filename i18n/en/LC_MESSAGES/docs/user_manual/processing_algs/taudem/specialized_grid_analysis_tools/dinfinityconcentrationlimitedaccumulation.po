"This function applies to the situation where an unlimited supply of a "
"substance is loaded into flow at a concentration or solubility threshold "
"Csol over a region indicated by an indicator grid (dg). It a grid of the "
"concentration of a substance at each location in the domain, where the "
"supply of substance from a supply area is loaded into the flow at a "
"concentration or solubility threshold. The flow is first calculated as a "
"D-infinity weighted contributing area of an input Effective Runoff Weight "
"Grid (notionally excess precipitation). The concentation of substance over "
"the supply area (indicator grid) is at the concentration threshold. As the "
"substance moves downslope with the D-infinity flow field, it is subject to "
"first order decay in moving from cell to cell as well as dilution due to "
"changes in flow. The decay multiplier grid gives the fractional (first "
"order) reduction in quantity in moving from grid cell ``x`` to the next "
"downslope cell. If the outlets shapefile is used, the tool only evaluates "
"the part of the domain that contributes flow to the locations given by the "
"shapefile. This is useful for a tracking a contaminant or compound from an "
"area with unlimited supply of that compound that is loaded into a flow at a "
"concentration or solubility threshold over a zone and flow from the zone may"
" be subject to decay or attenuation."
