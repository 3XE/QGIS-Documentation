"Creates an indicator grid (1, 0) that evaluates ``A >= (M)(Ly)`` based on "
"upslope path length, D8 contributing area grid inputs, and parameters ``M`` "
"and ``y``. This grid indicates likely stream source grid cells. This is an "
"experimental method with theoretical basis in Hack's law which states that "
"for streams ``L ~ A 0.6``. However for hillslopes with parallel flow ``L ~ "
"A``. So a transition from hillslopes to streams may be represented by ``L ~ "
"A 0.8`` suggesting identifying grid cells as stream cells if ``A > M (L "
"(1/0.8))``."

"A grid of the maximum upslope length for each cell. This is calculated as "
"the length of the flow path from the furthest cell that drains to each cell."
" Length is measured between cell centers taking into account cell size and "
"whether the direction is adjacent or diagonal. It is this length (``L``) "
"that is used in the formula, ``A >(M)(Ly)``, to determine which cells are "
"considered stream cells. This grid can be obtained as an output from the "
"**\"Grid Network\"** tool."
