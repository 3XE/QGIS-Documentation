"This tool orders the stream network according to the Strahler ordering "

"order 1. When two stream reaches of different order join the order of the "
"downstream reach is the order of the highest incoming reach. When two "
"reaches of equal order join the downstream reach order is increased by 1. "
"When more than two reaches join the downstream reach order is calculated as "
"the maximum of the highest incoming reach order or the second highest "
"incoming reach order + 1. This generalizes the common definition to cases "
"where more than two reaches join at a point. The network topological "
