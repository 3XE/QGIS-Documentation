"Calculates a grid of specific catchment area which is the contributing area "
"per unit contour length using the multiple flow direction D-infinity "
"approach. D-infinity flow direction is defined as steepest downward slope on"
" planar triangular facets on a block centered grid. The contribution at each"
" grid cell is taken as the grid cell length (or when the optional weight "
"grid input is used, from the weight grid). The contributing area of each "
"grid cell is then taken as its own contribution plus the contribution from "
"upslope neighbors that have some fraction draining to it according to the "
"D-infinity flow model. The flow from each cell either all drains to one "
"neighbor, if the angle falls along a cardinal (0, π/2, π, 3π/2) or ordinal "
"(π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4) direction, or is on an angle falling between the "
"direct angle to two adjacent neighbors. In the latter case the flow is "
"proportioned between these two neighbor cells according to how close the "
"flow direction angle is to the direct angle to those cells. The contour "
"length used here is the grid cell size. The resulting units of the specific "
"catchment area are length units the same as those of the grid cell size."

"When the optional weight grid is not used, the result is reported in terms "
"of specific catchment area, the upslope area per unit contour length, taken "
"here as the number of cells times grid cell length (cell area divided by "
"cell length). This assumes that grid cell length is the effective contour "
"length, in the definition of specific catchment area and does not "
"distinguish any difference in contour length dependent upon the flow "
"direction. When the optional weight grid is used, the result is reported "
"directly as a summation of weights, without any scaling."

"A grid of flow directions based on the D-infinity flow method using the "
"steepest slope of a triangular facet. Flow direction is determined as the "
"direction of the steepest downward slope on the 8 triangular facets of a 3x3"
" block centered grid. Flow direction is encoded as an angle in radians, "
"counter-clockwise from east as a continuous (floating point) quantity "
"between 0 and 2π. The resulting flow in a grid is then usually interpreted "
"as being proportioned between the two neighboring cells that define the "
"triangular facet with the steepest downward slope."
