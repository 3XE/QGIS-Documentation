"Creates 2 grids. The first contains the flow direction from each grid cell "
"to one of its adjacent or diagonal neighbors, calculated using the direction"
" of steepest descent. The second contain the slope, as evaluated in the "
"direction of steepest descent, and is reported as drop/distance, i.e. tan of"
" the angle. Flow direction is reported as NODATA for any grid cell adjacent "
"to the edge of the DEM domain, or adjacent to a NODATA value in the DEM. In "
"flat areas, flow directions are assigned away from higher ground and towards"
" lower ground using the method of Garbrecht and Martz (1997). The D8 flow "
"direction algorithm may be applied to a DEM that has not had its pits "
"filled, but it will then result in NODATA values for flow direction and "
"slope at the lowest point of each pit."

"A grid of elevation values. This is usually the output of the **\"Pit "
"Remove\"** tool, in which case it is elevations with pits removed. Pits are "
"low elevation areas in digital elevation models (DEMs) that are completely "
"surrounded by higher terrain. They are generally taken to be artifacts of "
"the digitation process that interfere with the processing of flow across "
"DEMs. So they are removed by raising their elevation to the point where they"
" just drain off the domain. This step is not essential if you have reason to"
" believe that the pits in your DEM are real. If a few pits actually exist "
"and so should not be removed, while at the same time others are believed to "
"be artifacts that need to be removed, the actual pits should have NODATA "
"elevation values inserted at their lowest point. NODATA values serve to "
"define edges of the domain in the flow field, and elevations are only raised"
" to where flow is off an edge, so an internal NODATA value will stop a pit "
"from being removed, if necessary."
