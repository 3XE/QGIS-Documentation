"Identifies all pits in the DEM and raises their elevation to the level of "
"the lowest pour point around their edge. Pits are low elevation areas in "
"digital elevation models (DEMs) that are completely surrounded by higher "
"terrain. They are generally taken to be artifacts that interfere with the "
"routing of flow across DEMs, so are removed by raising their elevation to "
"the point where they drain off the edge of the domain. The pour point is the"
" lowest point on the boundary of the \"watershed\" draining to the pit. This"
" step is not essential if you have reason to believe that the pits in your "
"DEM are real. If a few pits actually exist and so should not be removed, "
"while at the same time others are believed to be artifacts that need to be "
"removed, the actual pits should have NODATA elevation values inserted at "
"their lowest point. NODATA values serve to define edges in the domain, and "
"elevations are only raised to where flow is off an edge, so an internal "
"NODATA value will stop a pit from being removed, if necessary."
