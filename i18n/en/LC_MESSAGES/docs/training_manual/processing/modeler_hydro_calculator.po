"For this lesson, we are going to modify the hydrological model that we "
"created in the last chapter (open it in the modeler before starting), so we "
"can automate the calculation of a valid threshold value and we do not have "
"to ask the user to enter it. Since that value refers to the variable in the "
"threshold raster layer, we will extract it from that layer, based on some "
"simple statistical analysis."

"Starting with the aforemetioned model, let's do the following modifications:"

"If you double click on the  *Channel network* algorithm to modify it, as we "

"However, none of this values is suitable for being used as a valid "
"threshold, since they will result in channel networks that will not be very "
"realistic. We can, instead, derive some new parameter based on them, to get "
"a better result. For instance, we can use the mean plus 2 times the standard"
" deviation."

"To add that arithmetical operation, we can use the calculator that you will "

"provide some useful functionality when creating a model."
