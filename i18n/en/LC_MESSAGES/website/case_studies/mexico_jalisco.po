msgid "Within the years, the institution has gathered loads of information in several formats such as SHP, DWG, DXF, GeoTIFF and ECW, among others. So, what we wanted was to have all this information available, organized and in a common format with the purpose of being able to provide and display it over the Internet."

msgid "I decided to use Mapserver and PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension to be able to deliver our satellite imagery, orthopothos, digital elevation models and vector information with Web Map Services, thinking that any application will consume our services. But the problem was that many of the commercial and free applications don’t work with OGC standards, specially with WFS. After exploring many geographic information systems, I realized that QGIS was the only one which can connect to WMS, WCS and WFS successfully."

msgid "Internally, we use QGIS to check the raster and vector data of the agencies before publishing it, and after its integration, we used it again to test the Web services that we’ve created. Also, we have done many spatial analysis with QGIS pulling the data directly from our PostgreSQL spatial database, then, we export the results as shape files."
