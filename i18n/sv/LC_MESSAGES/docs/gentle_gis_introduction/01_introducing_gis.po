"A common feature of GIS is that they allow you to associate information (non-"
"geographical data) with places (geographical data). In fact, the GIS "
"Application can store many pieces of information which are associated with "
"each place --– something that paper maps are not very good at. For example, "
"our health care worker could store the person's age and gender on her table. "
"When the GIS Application draws the layer, you can tell it to draw the layer "
"based on gender, or based on disease type, and so on. So, with a GIS "
"Application we have a way to easily change the appearance of the maps we "
"created based on the non-geographical data associated with places."

"**Raster data** are stored as a grid of values. There are many satellites "
"circling the earth and the photographs they take are a kind of raster data "
"that can be viewed in a GIS. One important difference between raster and "
"vector data is that if you zoom in too much on a raster image, it will start "
"to appear 'blocky' (see illustrations figure_raster_data_1_ and "
"figure_raster_data_2_). In fact these blocks are the individual cells of the "
"data grid that makes up the raster image. We will be looking at raster data "
"in greater detail in later tutorials."
