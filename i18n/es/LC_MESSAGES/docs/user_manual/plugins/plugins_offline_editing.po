"For data collection, it is a common situation to work with a laptop or a "
"cell phone offline in the field. Upon returning to the network, the changes "
"need to be synchronized with the master data source, e.g. a PostGIS "
"database. If several persons are working simultaneously on the same "
"datasets, it is difficult to merge the edits by hand, even if people donâ€™t "
"change the same features."
