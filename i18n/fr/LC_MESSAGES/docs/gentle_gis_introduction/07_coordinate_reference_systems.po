"When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas have"
" the same proportional relationship to the areas on the Earth that they "
"represent, the map is an **equal area map**. In practice, general reference "

"projections**. As the name implies, these maps are best used when "
"calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, for"

"out whether it is large enough for a new shopping mall, equal area "
"projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you "

"equal area projection rather than another type. On the other hand, an equal "
"area projection results in** distortions of angular conformity** when "
"dealing with large areas. Small areas will be far less prone to having their"
" angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. **Alber's equal "

#~ "When viewed at close range the earth appears to be relatively flat. However "
#~ "when viewed from space, we can see that the earth is relatively spherical. "
#~ "Maps, as we will see in the upcoming map production topic, are "
#~ "representations of reality. They are designed to not only represent "
#~ "features, but also their shape and spatial arrangement. Each map projection "
#~ "has **advantages** and **disadvantages**. The best projection for a map "
#~ "depends on the **scale** of the map, and on the purposes for which it will "
#~ "be used. For example, a projection may have unacceptable distortions if used"
#~ " to map the entire African continent, but may be an excellent choice for a "
#~ "**large-scale (detailed) map** of your country. The properties of a map "
#~ "projection may also influence some of the design features of the map. Some "
#~ "projections are good for small areas, some are good for mapping areas with a"
#~ " large East-West extent, and some are better for mapping areas with a large "
#~ "North-South extent. **The three families of map projections**"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The process of creating map projections can be visualised by positioning a "
#~ "light source inside a transparent globe on which opaque earth features are "
#~ "placed. Then project the feature outlines onto a two-dimensional flat piece "
#~ "of paper. Different ways of projecting can be produced by surrounding the "
#~ "globe in a **cylindrical** fashion, as a **cone**, or even as a **flat "
#~ "surface**. Each of these methods produces what is called a **map projection "
#~ "family**. Therefore, there is a family of **planar projections**, a family "
#~ "of **cylindrical projections**, and another called **conical projections** "
#~ "(see )"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "**Accuracy of map projections**Map projections are never absolutely accurate"
#~ " representations of the spherical earth. As a result of the map projection "
#~ "process, every map shows **distortions of angular conformity, distance and "
#~ "area**. A map projection may combine several of these characteristics, or "
#~ "may be a compromise that distorts all the properties of area, distance and "
#~ "angular conformity, within some acceptable limit. Examples of compromise "
#~ "projections are the** Winkel Tripel projection** and the **Robinson "
#~ "projection** (see  ), which are often used for world maps."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "It is usually impossible to preserve all characteristics at the same time in"
#~ " a map projection. This means that when you want to carry out accurate "
#~ "analytical operations, you need to use a map projection that provides the "
#~ "best characteristics for your analyses. For example, if you need to measure "
#~ "distances on your map, you should try to use a map projection for your data "
#~ "that provides high accuracy for distances.**Map projections with angular "
#~ "conformity**When working with a globe, the main directions of the compass "
#~ "rose (North, East, South and West) will always occur at 90 degrees to one "
#~ "another. In other words, East will always occur at a 90 degree angle to "
#~ "North. Maintaining **correct angular properties** can be preserved on a map "
#~ "projection as well. A map projection that retains this property of angular "
#~ "conformity is called a **conformal or orthomorphic projection**."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "These projections are used when the **preservation of angular "
#~ "relationships** is important. They are commonly used for navigational or "
#~ "meteorological tasks. It is important to remember that maintaining true "
#~ "angles on a map is difficult for large areas and should be attempted only "
#~ "for small portions of the earth. The conformal type of projection results in"
#~ " distortions of areas, meaning that if area measurements are made on the "
#~ "map, they will be incorrect. The larger the area the less accurate the area "
#~ "measurements will be. Examples are the **Mercator projection** (as shown in"
#~ "  ) and the **Lambert Conformal Conic projection**. The U.S. Geological "
#~ "Survey uses a conformal projection for many of its topographic maps.**Map "

#~ msgid ""
#~ "When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas have"
#~ " the same proportional relationship to the areas on the Earth that they "
#~ "represent, the map is an **equal area map**. In practice, general reference "
#~ "and educational maps most often require the use of **equal area "
#~ "projections**. As the name implies, these maps are best used when "
#~ "calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, for"
#~ " example, you are trying to analyse a particular area in your town to find "
#~ "out whether it is large enough for a new shopping mall, equal area "
#~ "projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you "
#~ "are analysing, the more precise your area measures will be, if you use an "
#~ "equal area projection rather than another type. On the other hand, an equal "
#~ "area projection results in** distortions of angular conformity** when "
#~ "dealing with large areas. Small areas will be far less prone to having their"
#~ " angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. **Alber's equal "
#~ "area**, **Lambert's equal area** and **Mollweide Equal Area Cylindrical "
