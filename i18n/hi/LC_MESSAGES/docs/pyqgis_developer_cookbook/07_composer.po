msgid "Map composer is a very handy tool if you would like to do a more sophisticated output than the simple rendering shown above. Using the composer it is possible to create complex map layouts consisting of map views, labels, legend, tables and other elements that are usually present on paper maps. The layouts can be then exported to PDF, raster images or directly printed on a printer."

QGIS application has a convenient GUI for placement of the elements, though it is not available in the gui library. If you are not familiar with `Qt Graphics View framework <http://doc.qt.nokia.com/stable/graphicsview.html>`_, then you are encouraged to check the documentation now, because the composer is based on it."

msgid "Note that the composition takes an instance of :class:`QgsMapRenderer`. In the code we expect we are running within QGIS application and thus use the map renderer from map canvas. The composition uses various parameters from the map renderer, most importantly the default set of map layers and the current extent. When using composer in a standalone application, you can create your own map renderer instance the same way as shown in the section above and pass it to the composition."
