msgid "As a roads layer you can use any polyline vector layer in any QGIS supported format. Two lines with a common point are considered connected. Please note, it is required to use layer CRS as project CRS while editing roads layer. This is due to the fact that recalculation of the coordinates between different CRS introduce some errors that can result in discontinuities, even when 'snapping' is used."
