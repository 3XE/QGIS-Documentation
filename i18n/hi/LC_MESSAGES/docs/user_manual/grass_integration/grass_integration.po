Within this directory, the GRASS GIS data are organized by projects stored in subdirectories called :file:`LOCATION`. Each :file:`LOCATION` is defined by its coordinate system, map projection and geographical boundaries. Each :file:`LOCATION` can have several :file:`MAPSETs` (subdirectories of the :file:`LOCATION`) that are used to subdivide the project into different topics, subregions, or as workspaces for individual team members (Neteler & Mitasova 2008 :ref:`literature_and_web`). In order to analyze vector and raster layers with GRASS modules, you must import them into a GRASS :file:`LOCATION` (This is not strictly true - with the GRASS modules :file:`r.external` and :file:`v.external` you can create read-only links to external GDAL/OGR-supported data sets without importing them. But because this is not the usual way for beginners to work with GRASS, this functionality will not be described here.)."
