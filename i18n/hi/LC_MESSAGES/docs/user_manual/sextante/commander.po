msgid "The commander is started from the *Analysis* menu or, more practically, pressing ``Shift + Ctrl + M`` (you can change that default keyboard shortcut in the QGIS configuration if you prefer a different one). Apart from executing SEXTANTE algorithms, the commander gives you access to most of the functionality in QGIS, which means that it gives you a practical and efficient way of running QGIS tasks, and allows you to control QGIS reducing the usage of buttons and menus."
