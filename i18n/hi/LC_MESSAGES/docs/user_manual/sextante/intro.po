msgid "There are four basic elements in the SEXTANTE GUI, which are used to run SEXTANTE algorithms for different purposes. Choosing one tool or another will depend on the kind of analysis that is to be performed and the particular characteristics of each user and project. All of them (except for the batch processing interface, which is called from the toolbox, as we will see) can be accessed from the :menuselection:`Analysis` menu item (you will see more than four entries. The remaining ones are not used to execute algorithms and will be explained later in this chapter)."
