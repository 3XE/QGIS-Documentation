"**Topology** expresses the spatial relationships between connecting or "

"Topological or topology-based data are useful for detecting and correcting "
"digitising errors (e.g. two lines in a roads vector layer that do not meet "
"perfectly at an intersection). Topology is necessary for carrying out some "

"Imagine you travel to London. On a sightseeing tour you plan to visit St. "
"Paul's Cathedral first and in the afternoon Covent Garden Market for some "

"Covent Garden to St. Paul's. This requires topological information (data) "
"about where it is possible to change trains. Looking at a map of the "

"There are different types of topological errors and they can be grouped "
"according to whether the vector feature types are polygons or polylines. "
"Topological errors with **polygon** features can include unclosed polygons, "
"gaps between polygon borders or overlapping polygon borders. A common "
"topological error with **polyline** features is that they do not meet "
"perfectly at a point (node). This type of error is called an **undershoot** "
"if a gap exists between the lines, and an **overshoot** if a line ends "
"beyond the line it should connect to (see figure_topology_errors_)."

"Topological errors break the relationship between features. These errors "

"measurement (e.g. finding out the length of a river). In addition to "
"topology being useful for network analysis and measurement, there are other "

"correct topology. Just imagine you digitise a municipal boundaries map for "
"your province and the polygons overlap or show slivers. If such errors were "
"present, you would be able to use the measurement tools, but the results you "
