"In the **Result layer** section you have to define an output layer. You can "
"then define the extent of the calculation area based on an input raster "
"layer or based on X,Y coordinates and on Columns and Rows to set the "
"resolution of the output layer. If the input layer has a different "
"resolution, the values will be resampled with nearest neighbor algorithm."
