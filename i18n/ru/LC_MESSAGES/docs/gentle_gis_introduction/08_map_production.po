"Map production is the process of arranging map elements on a sheet of paper "
"in a way that, even without many words, the average person can understand "
"what it is all about. Maps are usually produced for presentations and "
"reports where the audience or reader is a politician, citizen or a learner "
"with no professional background in GIS. Because of this, a map has to be "
"effective in communicating spatial information. Common elements of a map are "
"the title, map body, legend, north arrow, scale bar, acknowledgement, and "
"map border (see figure_map_elements_)."

"Other elements that might be added are e.g. a **graticule**, or **name of "

"most important part of the map because it contains the map information. The "
"other elements support the communication process and help the map reader to "
"orientate himself and understand the map topic. For example, the title "
"describes the subject matter and the legend relates map symbols to the "

"A map is a simplified representation of the real world and **map symbols** "

"to provide a key to all the symbols used on the map. It is like a dictionary "

"legend is usually shown a a little box in a corner of the map. It contains "
"icons, each of which will represent a type of feature. For example, a "
"*house* icon will show you how to identify houses on the map (see "

"The scale of a map, is the value of a single unit of distance on the map, "
"representing distance in the real world. The values are shown in map units "

"**Expressing a scale in words** is a commonly used method and has the "
"advantage of being easily understood by most map users. You can see an "
"example of a word based scale in a figure_map_scale_ (a). Another option is "
"the **representative fraction (RF)** method, where both the map distance and "
"the ground distance in the real world are given in the same map units, as a "
"ratio. For example, a RF value 1:25,000 means that any distance on the map "
"is 1/25,000 *th* of the real distance on the ground (see figure_map_scale_ "
"(b)). The value 25,000 in the ratio is called the **scale denominator**. "
"More experienced users often prefer the representative fraction method, "
"because it reduces confusion."
