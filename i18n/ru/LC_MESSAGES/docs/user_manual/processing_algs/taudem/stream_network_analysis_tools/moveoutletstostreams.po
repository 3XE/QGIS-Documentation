"Moves outlet points that are not aligned with a stream cell from a stream "
"raster grid, downslope along the D8 flow direction until a stream raster "
"cell is encountered, the \"max_dist\" number of grid cells are examined, or "
"the flow path exits the domain (i.e. a \"no data\" value is encountered for "
"the D8 flow direction). The output file is a new outlets shapefile where "
"each point has been moved to coincide with the stream raster grid, if "
"possible. A field \"dist_moved\" is added to the new outlets shapefile to "
"indicate the changes made to each point. Points that are already on a stream"
" cell are not moved and their \"dist_moved\" field is assigned a value 0. "
"Points that are initially not on a stream cell are moved by sliding them "
"downslope along the D8 flow direction until one of the following occurs: a) "
"A stream raster grid cell is encountered before traversing the \"max_dist\" "
"number of grid cells. In which case, the point is moved and the "
"\"dist_moved\" field is assigned a value indicating how many grid cells the "
"point was moved. b) More than the \"max_number\" of grid cells are "
"traversed, or c) the traversal ends up going out of the domain (i.e., a \"no"
" data\" D8 flow direction value is encountered). In which case, the point is"
" not moved and the \"dist_moved\" field is assigned a value of -1."
