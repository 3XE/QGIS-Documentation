"Assigns a flow direction based on the D-infinity flow method using the "
"steepest slope of a triangular facet (Tarboton, 1997, \"A New Method for the"
" Determination of Flow Directions and Contributing Areas in Grid Digital "
"Elevation Models\", Water Resources Research, 33(2): 309-319). Flow "
"direction is defined as steepest downward slope on planar triangular facets "
"on a block centered grid. Flow direction is encoded as an angle in radians "
"counter-clockwise from east as a continuous (floating point) quantity "
"between 0 and 2π. The flow direction angle is determined as the direction of"
" the steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets formed in a 3 x "
"3 grid cell window centered on the grid cell of interest. The resulting flow"
" in a grid is then usually interpreted as being proportioned between the two"
" neighboring cells that define the triangular facet with the steepest "
"downward slope."

"A block-centered representation is used with each elevation value taken to "
"represent the elevation of the center of the corresponding grid cell. Eight "
"planar triangular facets are formed between each grid cell and its eight "
"neighbors. Each of these has a downslope vector which when drawn outwards "
"from the center may be at an angle that lies within or outside the 45 degree"
" (π/4 radian) angle range of the facet at the center point. If the slope "
"vector angle is within the facet angle, it represents the steepest flow "
"direction on that facet. If the slope vector angle is outside a facet, the "
"steepest flow direction associated with that facet is taken along the "
"steepest edge. The slope and flow direction associated with the grid cell is"
" taken as the magnitude and direction of the steepest downslope vector from "
"all eight facets. Slope is measured as drop/distance, i.e. tan of the slope "
"angle."

"In the case where no slope vectors are positive (downslope), the flow "
"direction is set using the method of Garbrecht and Martz (1997) for the "
"determination of flow across flat areas. This makes flat areas drain away "
"from high ground and towards low ground. The flow path grid to enforce "
"drainage along existing streams is an optional input, and if used, takes "
"precedence over elevations for the setting of flow directions."
