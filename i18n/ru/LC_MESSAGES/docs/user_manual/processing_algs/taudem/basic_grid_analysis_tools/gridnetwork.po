"Strahler order is defined as follows: A network of flow paths is defined by "
"the D8 Flow Direction grid. Source flow paths have a Strahler order number "
"of one. When two flow paths of different order join the order of the "
"downstream flow path is the order of the highest incoming flow path. When "
"two flow paths of equal order join the downstream flow path order is "
"increased by 1. When more than two flow paths join the downstream flow path "
"order is calculated as the maximum of the highest incoming flow path order "
"or the second highest incoming flow path order + 1. This generalizes the "
"common definition to cases where more than two flow paths join at a point."
