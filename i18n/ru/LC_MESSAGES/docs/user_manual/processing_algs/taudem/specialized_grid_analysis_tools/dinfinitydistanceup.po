"This tool calculates the distance from each grid cell up to the ridge cells "
"along the reverse D-infinity flow directions. Ridge cells are defined to be "
"grid cells that have no contribution from grid cells further upslope. Given "
"the convergence of multiple flow paths at any grid cell, any given grid cell"
" can have multiple upslope ridge cells. There are three statictical methods "
"that this tool can use: maximum distance, minimum distance and waited flow "
"average over these flow paths. A variant on the above is to consider only "
"grid cells that contribute flow with a proportion greater than a user "
"specified threshold (t) to be considered as upslope of any given grid cell. "
"Setting t=0.5 would result in only one flow path from any grid cell and "
"would give the result equivalent to a D8 flow model, rather than D-infinity "
"flow model, where flow is proportioned between two downslope grid cells. "
"Finally there are several different optional paths that can be measured: the"
" total straight line path (Pythagoras), the horizontal component of the "
"straight line path, the vertical component of the straight line path, or the"
" total surface flow path."

"Statistical method used to calculate the distance down to the stream. In the"
