"This input is a grid of elevation values. As a general rule, it is "
"recommended that you use a grid of elevation values that have had the pits "
"removed for this input. Pits are generally taken to be artifacts that "
"interfere with the analysis of flow across them. This grid can be obtained "
"as the output of the **\"Pit Remove\"** tool, in which case it contains "
"elevation values where the pits have been filled to the point where they "
"just drain."
