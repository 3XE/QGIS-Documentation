"Identifies an avalanche's affected area and the flow path length to each "
"cell in that affacted area. All cells downslope from each source area cell, "
"up to the point where the slope from the source to the affected area is less"
" than a threshold angle called the Alpha Angle can be in the affected area. "
"This tool uses the D-infinity multiple flow direction method for determining"
" flow direction. This will likely cause very small amounts of flow to be "
"dispersed to some downslope cells that might overstate the affected area, so"
" a threshold proportion can be set to avoid this excess dispersion. The flow"
" path length is the distance from the cell in question to the source cell "
"that has the highest angle."

"It makes more physical sense to me for the angle to be measured along the "
"flow path. Nevertheless it is equally easy to code straight line angles as "
"angles along the flow path, so an option that allows switching will be "
"provided. The most practical way to evaluate avalanche runout is to keep "
"track of the source point with the greatest angle to each point. Then the "
"recursive upslope flow algebra approach will look at a grid cell and all its"
" upslope neighbors that flow to it. Information from the upslope neighbors "
"will be used to calculate the angle to the grid cell in question and retain "
"it in the runout zone if the angle exceeds the alpha angle. This procedure "
"makes the assumption that the maximum angle at a grid cell will be from the "
"set of cells that have maximum angles to the inflowing neighbors. This will "
"always be true of angle is calculated along a flow path, but I can conceive "
"of cases where flow paths bend back on themselves where this would not be "
"the case for straight line angles."

"The D-infinity multiple flow direction field assigns flow from each grid "
"cell to multiple downslope neighbors using proportions (``Pik``) that vary "
"between 0 and 1 and sum to 1 for all flows out of a grid cell. It may be "
"desirable to specify a threshold ``T`` that this proportion has to exceed "
"before a grid cell is counted as flowing to a downslope grid cell, e.g. "
"``Pik > T`` (=0.2 say) to avoid dispersion to grid cells that get very "
"little flow. ``T`` will be specified as a user input. If all upslope grid "
"cells are to be used ``T`` may be input as 0."
