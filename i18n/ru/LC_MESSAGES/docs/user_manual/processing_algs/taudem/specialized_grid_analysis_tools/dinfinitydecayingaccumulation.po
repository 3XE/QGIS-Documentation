"The D-Infinity Decaying Accumulation tool creates a grid of the accumulated "
"quantity at each location in the domain where the quantity accumulates with "
"the D-infinity flow field, but is subject to first order decay in moving "
"from cell to cell. By default, the quantity contribution of each grid cell "
"is the cell length to give a per unit width accumulation, but can optionally"
" be expressed with a weight grid. The decay multiplier grid gives the "
"fractional (first order) reduction in quantity in accumulating from grid "
"cell ``x`` to the next downslope cell."

"A decayed accumulation operator ``DA[.]`` takes as input a mass loading "
"field ``m(x)`` expressed at each grid location as ``m(i, j)`` that is "
"assumed to move with the flow field but is subject to first order decay in "
"moving from cell to cell. The output is the accumulated mass at each "
"location ``DA(x)``. The accumulation of ``m`` at each grid cell can be "

"Here ``d(x) = d(i ,j)`` is a decay multiplier giving the fractional (first "
"order) reduction in mass in moving from grid cell ``x`` to the next "
"downslope cell. If travel (or residence) times ``t(x)`` associated with flow"
" between cells are available ``d(x)`` may be evaluated as ``exp(-k t(x))`` "
"where ``k`` is a first order decay parameter. The weight grid is used to "
"represent the mass loading ``m(x)``. If not specified this is taken as 1. If"
" the outlets shapefile is used the function is only evaluated on that part "
"of the domain that contributes flow to the locations given by the shapefile."
