"This function is designed to calculate the transport and deposition of a "
"substance (e.g. sediment) that may be limited by both supply and the "
"capacity of the flow field to transport it. This function accumulates "
"substance flux (e.g. sediment transport) subject to the rule that transport "
"out of any grid cell is the minimum between supply and transport capacity, "
"``Tcap``. The total supply at a grid cell is calculated as the sum of the "
"transport in from upslope grid cells, ``Tin``, plus the local supply "
"contribution, ``E`` (e.g. erosion). This function also outputs deposition, "
"``D``, calculated as total supply minus actual transport."
