"The D-Infinity Upslope Dependence tool quantifies the amount each grid cell "
"in the domain contributes to a destination set of grid cells. D-Infinity "
"flow directions proportion flow from each grid cell between multiple "
"downslope grid cells. Following this flow field downslope the amount of flow"
" originating at each grid cell that reaches the destination zone is defined."
" Upslope influence is evaluated using a downslope recursion, examining grid "
"cells downslope from each grid cell, so that the map produced identifies the"
" area upslope where flow through the destination zone originates, or the "
"area it depends on, for its flow."

"the indicator weighted contributing area function is denoted ``I(y; x)`` "
"giving the weighted contribution using a unit value (1) from specific grid "
