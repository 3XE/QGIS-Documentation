"Map composer is a very handy tool if you would like to do a more "
"sophisticated output than the simple rendering shown above. Using the "
"composer it is possible to create complex map layouts consisting of map "
"views, labels, legend, tables and other elements that are usually present on "
"paper maps. The layouts can be then exported to PDF, raster images or "
"directly printed on a printer."

"The composer consists of a bunch of classes. They all belong to the core "

"familiar with `Qt Graphics View framework <http://doc.qt.nokia.com/stable/"
"graphicsview.html>`_, then you are encouraged to check the documentation "
"now, because the composer is based on it."

"Note that the composition takes an instance of :class:`QgsMapRenderer`. In "
"the code we expect we are running within QGIS application and thus use the "

"the map renderer, most importantly the default set of map layers and the "
"current extent. When using composer in a standalone application, you can "
"create your own map renderer instance the same way as shown in the section "
"above and pass it to the composition."
