"Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display information"
" that is continuous across an area and cannot easily be divided into vector "
"features. When we introduced you to vector data we showed you the image in "
"figure_landscape_. Point, polyline and polygon features work well for "
"representing some features on this landscape, such as trees, roads and "
"building footprints. Other features on a landscape can be more difficult to "
"represent using vector features. For example the grasslands shown have many "
"variations in colour and density of cover. It would be easy enough to make a"
" single polygon around each grassland area, but a lot of the information "
"about the grassland would be lost in the process of simplifying the features"
" to a single polygon. This is because when you give a vector feature "
"attribute values, they apply to the whole feature, so vectors aren't very "
"good at representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the same) "
"all over. Another approach you could take is to digitise every small "
"variation of grass colour and cover as a separate polygon. The problem with "
"that approach is that it will take a huge amount of work in order to create "
"a good vector dataset."

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster "
"data as a **backdrop** to be used behind vector layers in order to provide "
"more meaning to the vector information. The human eye is very good at "
"interpreting images and so using an image behind vector layers, results in "
"maps with a lot more meaning. Raster data is not only good for images that "
"depict the real world surface (e.g. satellite images and aerial "
"photographs), they are also good for representing more abstract ideas. For "
"example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an area, or to "
"depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of applications, each "
"cell in the raster represents a different value e.g. risk of fire on a scale"

"Georeferencing is the process of defining exactly where on the earth's "

"Because having images containing multiple bands of light is so useful in "
"GIS, raster data are often provided as multi-band images. Each band in the "
