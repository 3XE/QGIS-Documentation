<p>% when the revision of a section has been finalized,

% updatedisclaimer</p>
<p>In recent years, the OpenStreetMap project has gained popularity because in many countries no free geodata such as digital roadmaps are available.
The objective of the OSM project is to create a free editable map of the world from GPS data, aerial photography or from local knowledge. To
support this objective, QGIS provides a plugin that enables its users to work with OSM data.</p>
<p>This plugin provides the basic functionalities for OSM data manipulation; this includes data loading, importing, saving, downloading, editing and
uploading data back to the OpenStreetMap server. While implementing the OSM plugin an inspiration was taken from existing OSM data editors. The
purpose was to combine their functionalities to get the best possible result.</p>
<p>The following section gives a brief introduction to principles of the OSM project. If you are not interested in information on OSM just skip the next
section. Parts of the following paragraphs are copied from the OpenStreetMap web site at url{<a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">http://www.openstreetmap.org</a>}.

<h2>The OpenStreetMap project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-openstreetmap-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>OpenStreetMap is a project to create a free editable map of the world. The maps are created using data from portable GPS devices, aerial photography,
other free sources or simply from local knowledge. The project was started because most maps have legal or technical restrictions on their use, restricting people from using them in creative, productive, or unexpected ways. Both rendered images and the vector dataset of OSM are available for download under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 2.0 license.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>begin{figure}[ht]</dt>
<dd>centering
includegraphics[clip=true, width=10cm]{osmweb}
caption{OpenStreetMap data in the web nixcaption}label{fig:osmweb}</dd>
</dl>
<p>end{figure}</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap was inspired by sites such as Wikipedia - the map display
(see Figure ref{fig:osmweb}) features a prominent tab{Edit} tab and a
full revision history is maintained. Registered users can upload GPS track
logs and edit the vector data using the given editing tools.</p>
<p>OSM data primitive is an object class that can be stored via the API in the
server. The three supported types of data are: <strong>Node}, textbf{Way</strong>
and <strong>Relation</strong>.</p>
<p>[label=&#8211;]
*  <strong>A node</strong> is a latitude/longitude pair of coordinates. It is
used as building a block for other features and as a feature itself (Points
Of Interest), if they are tagged as required.
*  <strong>A way</strong> is a list of at least two nodes that describe a linear
feature such as a street, or similar. Nodes can be members of multiple ways.
*  <strong>A relation</strong> is a group of zero or more primitives with
associated roles. It is used to specify relationships between objects,
and may also model an abstract object.</p>
<p>Several different logical features in a common map (&#8216;Point Of Interest&#8217;,
&#8216;Street&#8217;, &#8216;Tram Line&#8217;, &#8216;Bus Stop&#8217; etc.) are defined by these primitives.
Map features are well-known in the OSM community and are stored as tags,
based on a key and a value. OSM is usually distributed in XML format. XML
payload is used for the communication with the OSM server as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="qgis-osm-connection-label-qgis-osm-connection">
<h2>QGIS - OSM Connection}label{qgis-osm-connection<a class="headerlink" href="#qgis-osm-connection-label-qgis-osm-connection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first part of this section describes how OSM data primitives
are displayed in QGIS vector layers. As previously mentioned, OSM data consists of
Nodes, Ways and Relations. In QGIS, they are displayed in three different
layer types: Point layer, Line layer and Polygon layer. It is not possible
to remove any of these layers and work with the other ones. % I&#8217;m not sure what this phrase &#8216;work with the other ones&#8217; means</p>
<p>[label=&#8211;]
*  A <strong>Point layer</strong> displays all features of type Node that stands
alone. That means that only Nodes that are not included in any Way belongs
to the Point layer.
*  A <strong>Line layer</strong> displays those OSM features of type Way that are
not closed. That means, none of these Ways starts and ends with the
same Node.
*  A <strong>Polygon layer</strong> displays all Ways that are not included in
Line layer.</p>
<p>OpenStreetMap has one more data primitive in addition to the three mentioned
above. This is called <strong>Relation</strong>. There is purposely no vector layer
to display Relations. A Relation defines a connection between any number of
data primitives. After a Point, Line or Polygon is identified on a map,
the plugin shows a list of all relations which the identified feature is part of.</p>
<p>It was challenging to design the connection between OSM data and the
standard QGIS editing tools. These tools are made to edit a single vector
layer at a time, no matter of what feature types it displays. This means
that if OSM data are loaded to QGIS through the plugin, you could
(theoretically) edit the Point layer, Line layer or Polygon layer with these
standard tools separately.</p>
<p>A Line layer consists of two different types of OSM features, Ways and Nodes. In OSM format, a Way is composed of Nodes. If you start editing a Line layer and change the shape of some line, your action affects not only the OSM Way, but also the OSM Nodes that are part of it.</p>
<p>QGIS standard editing tools cannot tell the OSM provider, which members
of which line has changed and how. It can tell only what&#8217;s the new geometry
of which line, and that&#8217;s not enough to propagate changes to the OSM database
correctly. The Line layer does also not know the identifiers of the line
members. The same problem occurs when you try to edit the Polygon layer.</p>
<p>For this reason, the OSM plugin need its own tools for editing OSM data.
While they are used, the OSM layers can be changed correctly. The Plugin
editing tools consists of tools for Point, Line, Polygon and
Relation creation, deletion and moving.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To create a connection between the OSM plugin and standard
editing tools, changes in QuantumGIS core code would be necessary.</p>
<div class="section" id="installation">

<p>The OSM Feature widget helps to identify OSM features. It
shows basic information on the feature type and identifier as well as information on
who has changed a feature, and when. The OSM Feature widget also provides all
editing tools (in the top part of it). More information on those tools can be

<h3>Loading OSM data<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-osm-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first action that should be done after starting the OSM Plugin is
opening data from an OSM file. OSM data can be import as shapefile or
downloaded directly from the OpenStreetMap server. Here we are focusing
on the first mentioned method.</p>
<p>To load data from a file use the toolbtntwo{osm_load}{Load OSM from file}
icon. If there is no such button, maybe someone disabled OpenStreetMap
toolbar in your QGIS installation. You can enable it again selecting
mainmenuopt{Settings} arrow mainmenuopt{Toolbars} arrow dropmenuopt{OpenStreetMap}.</p>

<p>end{figure}</p>
<p>The purpose of its elements is explained below.</p>
<p>begin{description}
item <strong>OpenStreetMap file to load</strong>: Click on the button to select
the .osm file you want to load data from.
item <strong>Add columns for tags</strong>: This option determines a connection
between OSM and QGIS data. Each feature of OSM data has
some tags (pairs of key and value), that define the feature properties.
Each feature of a QGIS vector layer also has its attributes (key and value).
With this option you can define which properties of OSM objects should
be visible when displaying detailed information about QGIS features.
item <strong>Replace current data</strong>: Checking this option means that
new data should replace current data the user is working with. Layers of
current data will be removed and new ones will be loaded. When loading
OSM data for the first time, this option is not active, because there is
nothing to replace.
item <strong>Use custom renderer</strong>: This option determines how many details
of the map will be used. There are three pre-defined OSM styles for map
displaying. Use button{Small scale} if you want to view OSM data at low level,
to see all details and to edit something. If not you can use
button{Medium scale} or button{Large scale}. QGIS CURRENT doesn&#8217;t
support changing the renderer style dynamically.
end{description}</p>
<p>Click button{Ok} to load your data. If this is the first time the OSM
file is loaded, the plugin must first parse the database. This may take few
seconds or minutes - it depends on the amount of loaded data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewing-osm-data">
<h3>Viewing OSM data<a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-osm-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the OSM data are loaded, you can identify map features using the
appropriate tool. Use the toolbtntwo{osm_identify}{Identify feature}
button on the top-left of the OSM Feature widget. Using this tool you can
easily explore all map objects. When the mouse cursor is placed over an
object, you can see all information on it directly in the OSM Feature widget.
There is also a dynamic rubberband displayed on the map so that the user
is able to determine which feature is currently identified.</p>
<p>The tab{Properties} tab of the widget contains of all feature tags.
Clicking on the tab{Relation} tab shows you a list of all relations
connected with identified feature.</p>
<p>If you want to hold a feature for a while to be able to read its properties
and relations, move the mouse cursor at the same time, try left-clicking
while you are over the feature. Identification process will stop until next
left-clicking.</p>
<p>Sometimes there is more than one feature at a point where left-clicking
was performed. This happens especially when clicking on cross-roads or if
you did not zoom enough into the map. In this situation only one of such
features is identified (and marked with the rubberband) but the plugin
remembers all of them. Then (still in the pause mode) you can cycle through the
identified features by right-clicking.</p>

<div class="section" id="editing-basic-osm-data">
<h3>Editing basic OSM data<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-basic-osm-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>&#8216;Basic data&#8217;  in this context means non-relational OSM features -
nodes and ways. If you prefer to examine how to perform relational editing,
skip this section and move on to the next one.</p>
<p>Basic data editing is a key part of the OSM Plugin. You can change the property,
position or shape of any existing basic feature. You can remove features or
add new ones. All changes on nodes and ways are remembered by Undo/Redo all
changes can be easily uploaded to the OpenStreetMap server.</p>

<div class="section" id="changing-feature-tags">
<h2>Changing feature tags<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-feature-tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Changing the property/tag of an OSM feature can be done directly in
the table of feature tags. The Tags table of basic features can be found
on the OSM Feature widget. Don&#8217;t forget to identify feature first.</p>

<p>If you want to change a tag value, just double-click in the appropriate row of
column &#8216;Value&#8217; and type, or select a new value. If you want to remove a tag,
click in the relevant row, then use the button button{Remove selected tags} on the right
bottom under the table.</p>
<p>To add new tags just type the key and value into the last row of the table
where &#8216;&lt;next tag value&gt;&#8217; is written. Notice that you cannot change the key of
an existing tag pair. Conveniently, there are some combo boxes of all
existing tag keys and their typical values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="point-creation">
<h2>Point creation<a class="headerlink" href="#point-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For point creation there is a toolbtntwo{osm_createPoint}{Create point}
button on the OSM Feature widget. To create some points, just click on the
button and start clicking on the map. If your cursor is over some map
feature, the feature is marked/identified immediately. If you click on
the map when a line or polygon is marked, a new point is created directly on
such line or polygon as its new member. If your cursor is over an existing
point, a new point cannot be created. In such case the OSM plugin will show
following message:</p>

<p>end{figure}</p>
<p>The mechanism of helping a user to hit the line or polygon is called snapping
and is enabled by default. If you want to create a point very close to some
line (but not on it) you must disable snapping by holding the
keystroke{Ctrl} key first.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="line-creation">
<h2>Line creation<a class="headerlink" href="#line-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For line creation, there is a toolbtntwo{osm_createLine}{Create line} button
on the OSM Feature widget. To create a line just click the button and start
left-clicking on the map. Each of your left-clicks is remembered as a
vertex of the new line. Line creation ends when the first right-click is performed.
The new line will immediately appear on the map.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A Line with less than two members cannot be created. In
such case the operation is ignored.</p>
<p>Snapping is performed to all map vertices - points from the Point vector layer
and all Line and Polygon members. Snapping can be disabled by holding the
keystroke{Ctrl} key.</p>

<h2>Polygon creation<a class="headerlink" href="#polygon-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For polygon creation there is a toolbtntwo{osm_createPolygon}{Create polygon}
button on the OSM Feature widget. To create a polygon just click the button
and start left-clicking on the map. Each of your left-clicks is remembered as
a member vertex of the new polygon. The Polygon creation ends when first
right-click is performed. The new polygon will immediately appear on the map.
Polygon with less than three members cannot be created. In such case
operation is ignored. Snapping is performed to all map vertexes - points

<div class="section" id="map-feature-moving">
<h2>Map feature moving<a class="headerlink" href="#map-feature-moving" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to move a feature (no matter what type) please use the
toolbtntwo{osm_move}{Move feature} button from the OSM Feature widget menu.
Then you can browse the map (features are identified dynamically when you
go over them) and click on the feature you want to move. If a wrong feature is
selected after your click, don&#8217;t move it from the place. Repeat right-clicking
until the correct feature is identified. When selection is done and you move
the cursor, you are no more able to change your decision what to move.
To confirm the move, click on the left mouse button. To cancel a move, click
another mouse button.</p>
<p>If you are moving a feature that is connected to another features, these
connections won&#8217;t be damaged. Other features will just adapt themselves to
a new position of a moved feature.</p>
<p>Snapping is also supported in this operation, this means:</p>
<p>[label=&#8211;]
*  When moving a standalone (not part of any line/polygon) point,
snapping to all map segments and vertices is performed.
*  When moving a point that is a member of some lines/polygons,
snapping to all map segments and vertices is performed, except for
vertices of point parents.
*  When moving a line/polygon, snapping to all map vertices is performed.
Note that the OSM Plugin tries to snap only to the 3 closest-to-cursor
vertices of a moved line/polygon, otherwise the operation would by very slow.
Snapping can be disabled by holding keystroke{Ctrl} key during the operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="map-feature-removing">
<h2>Map feature removing<a class="headerlink" href="#map-feature-removing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to remove a feature, you must identify it first. To remove
an identified feature, use the toolbtntwo{osm_removeFeat}{Remove this
feature} button on the OSM Feature widget. When removing a line/polygon,
the line/polygon itself is deleted, so are all its member points that
doesn&#8217;t belong to any other line/polygon.</p>
<p>When removing a point that is member of some lines/polygons, the point is
deleted and the geometries of parent lines/polygons are changed. The new
parent geometry has less vertices than the old one.</p>
<p>If the parent feature was a polygon with three vertexes, its new geometry
has only two vertexes. And because there cannot exist polygon with only two
vertices, as described above, the feature type is automatically changed to
Line.</p>
<p>If the parent feature was a line with two vertexes, its new geometry has
only one vertex. And because there cannot exist a line with only one vertex,
the feature type is automatically changed to Point.</p>

<h3>Editing relations}label{editing_osm_relation<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-relations-label-editing-osm-relation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to existence of OSM relations we can join OSM features into groups and
give them common properties - in such way we can model any possible map
object: borders of a region (as group of ways and points), routes of a bus,
etc. Each member of a relation has its specific role. There is a pretty good
support for OSM Relations in our plugin. Let&#8217;s see how to examine, create,
update or remove them.</p>

<div class="section" id="examining-relation-label-examrelation">
<h2>Examining relation}label{examrelation<a class="headerlink" href="#examining-relation-label-examrelation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you want to see relation properties, first identify one of its members.
After that open the tab{Relations} tab on the OSM Feature widget. At the
top of the tab you can see a list of all relations the identified feature
is part of. Please choose the one you want to examine and look at its
information below. In the first table called &#8216;Relation tags&#8217; you find the
properties of the selected relation. In the table called &#8216;Relation members&#8217;
you see brief information on the relation members. If you click on a member,
the plugin will make a rubberband on it in the map.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="relation-creation">
<h2>Relation creation<a class="headerlink" href="#relation-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are 2 ways to create a relation:</p>
<p>#.  You can use the toolbtntwo{osm_createRelation}{Create relation}
button on OSM Feature widget.
#.  You can create it from the tab{Relation} tab of OSM Feature widget
using the toolbtntwo{osm_addRelation}{Add relation} button.</p>
<p>In both cases a dialog will appear. For the second case, the feature that
is currently identified is automatically considered to be the first
relation member, so the dialog is prefilled a little. When creating
a relation, please select its type first. You can select one of
predefined relation types or write your own type. After that fill the
relation tags and choose its members.</p>
<p>If you have already selected a relation type, try using the
toolbtntwo{osm_generateTags}{Generate tags} button. It will generate typical
tags to your relation type. Then you are expected to enter values to the
keys. Choosing relation members can be done either by writing member
identifiers, types and roles or using the toolbtntwo{osm_identify}{identify}
tool and clicking on map.</p>
<p>Finally when type, tags and members are chosen, the dialog can be submitted.
In such case the plugin creates a new relation for you.</p>

on the OSM Feature widget. A new dialog appears, nearly the same as for the
&#8216;create relation&#8217; action. The dialog is pre-filled with information on
given relations. You can change relation tags, members or even its type.
After submitting the dialog your changes will be committed.</p>

<h3>Downloading OSM data<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-osm-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To download data from OpenStreetMap server click on the
toolbtntwo{osm_download}{Download OSM data} button. If there is no
such button, the OSM toolbar may be disabled in your QGIS instalation.
You can enable it again at mainmenuopt{Settings} arrow
mainmenuopt{Toolbars} arrow dropmenuopt{OpenStreetMap}. After clicking the
button a dialog occurs and provides following functionalities:</p>

</dl>
<p>end{figure}</p>
<p>begin{description}
item <strong>Extent</strong>: Specifies an area to download data from intervals
of latitude and longitude degrees. Because there is some restriction of
OpenStreetMap server on how much data can be downloaded, the intervals
must not be too wide. More detailed info on extent specification can is
shown after clicking the toolbtntwo{osm_questionMark}{help} button on
the right.
item <strong>Download to</strong>: Here you are expected to write a path to the
file where data will be stored. If you can&#8217;t remember the structure of
your disk, don&#8217;t panic. The button{browse} button will help you.
item <strong>Open data automatically after download</strong>: Determines, if the
download process should be followed by loading the data process or not. If you
prefer not to load data now, you can do it later by using
the toolbtntwo{osm_load}{Load OSM from file} button.
item <strong>Replace current data</strong>: This option is active only if
radiobuttonon{Open data automatically after download} is checked.
Checking this option means that downloaded data should replace
current data we are working with now. Layers of the current data will be
removed and new ones will be loaded. When starting QGIS and downloading
OSM data for the first time, this option is initially inactive, because
there is nothing to replace.
item <strong>Use custom renderer</strong>: This option is active only if the
radiobuttonon{Open data automatically after download} checkbox is checked.
It determines how many details will be in the map. There are three predefined
OSM styles for map displaying. Use button{Small scale} if you want to view
OSM data at low level, to see all details and to edit something. If not you
can use button{Medium scale} or button{Large scale}. QGIS CURRENT does
not support changing the renderer style dynamically.
end{description}</p>
<p>Click the button{Download} button to start the download process.</p>
<p>A progress dialog will continuously inform you about how much of data is
already downloaded. When an error occurs during the download process, a
dialog tells you why. When action finishes successfully both the progress dialog
and download dialog will close themselves.</p>

<h3>Uploading OSM data<a class="headerlink" href="#uploading-osm-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Note that the upload is always done on current OSM data. Before opening the
OSM Upload dialog, please be sure that you really have the right active
layer ~ OSM data.</p>
<p>To upload current data to the OSM server click on the
toolbtntwo{osm_upload}{Upload OSM data} button. If there is no such button,
OSM toolbar in your QGIS installation is disabled. You can enable it
again in mainmenuopt{Settings} arrow mainmenuopt{Toolbars} arrow

<p>At the top of the dialog you can check, if you are uploading the correct data.
There is a short name of a current database. In the table you find information
on how many changes will be uploaded. Statistics are displayed separately
for each feature type.</p>
<p>In the &#8216;Comment on your changes&#8217; box you can write brief information on
meaning of your upload operation. Just write in brief what data changes
you&#8217;ve done or let the box empty.
Fill &#8216;OSM account&#8217; arrays so that the server could authenticate you. If
you don&#8217;t have an account on the OSM server, it&#8217;s the best time to create
one at url{<a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">http://www.openstreetmap.org</a>}. Finally use button{Upload} to
start an upload operation.</p>

<h3>Saving OSM data<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-osm-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To save data from a current map extent to an XML file click on the
toolbtntwo{osm_save}{Save OSM to file} button. If there is no such button,
the OSM toolbar in your QuantumGIS installation is probably disabled. You can
enable it again in mainmenuopt{Settings} arrow mainmenuopt{Toolbars} arrow

<p>end{figure}</p>
<p>Select features you want to save into XML file and the file itself. Use
the button{Ok} button to start the operation. The process will create an
XML file, in which OSM data from your current map extent are represented.
The OSM version of the output file is 0.6. Elements of OSM data
(&lt;node&gt;, &lt;way&gt;, &lt;relation&gt;) do not contain information on their changesets
and uids. This information are not compulsory yet, see DTD for
OSM XML version 0.6. In the output file OSM elements are not ordered.</p>
<p>Notice that not only data from the current extent are saved. Into the output
file the whole polygons and lines are saved even if only a small part of them
is visible in the current extent. For each saved line/polygon all its member
nodes are saved too.</p>

<h3>Import OSM data<a class="headerlink" href="#import-osm-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To import OSM data from an opened non-OSM vector layer follow this
instructions: Choose current OSM data by clicking on one of their layers.
Click on the toolbtntwo{osm_import}{Import data from a layer} button. If
there is no such button, someone has probably disable the OpenStreetMap
toolbar in your QGIS installation. You can enable it again in

<p>end{figure}</p>
<p>In such case there is no vector layer currently loaded. The import must be d
one from a loaded layer - please load a vector layer from which you want to
import data. After a layer is opened, your second try should give you a
better result (don&#8217;t forget to mark the current OSM layer again):</p>
