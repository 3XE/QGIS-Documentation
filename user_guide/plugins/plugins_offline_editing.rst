For data collection, it is a common situation to work with a laptop or a cell 
phone offline in the field. Upon returning to the network, the changes need to 
be synchronized with the master data source, e.g. a PostGIS database. If several 
persons are working simultaneously on the same datasets, it is difficult to 
merge the edits by hand, even if people donâ€™t change the same features.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The |offline_editing_copy| :guilabel:`Offline Editing` Plugin automates the 
synchronization by copying the content of a datasource (usually PostGIS or 
WFS-T) to a spatialite database and storing the offline edits to dedicated 
tables. After being connected to the network again, it is possible to apply the 
offline edits to the master dataset.

Using the plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Open some vector layers, e.g. from a PostGIS or WFS-T datasource.
*  Save it as a project.
