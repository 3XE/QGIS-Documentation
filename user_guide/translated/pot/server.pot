msgid "QGIS Server is an open source WMS 1.3 implementation which, in addition, implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. The QGIS Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application written in C++ that works together with a webserver (e.g. Apache, Lighttpd). It is funded by the EU projects Orchestra, Sany and the city of Uster in Switzerland."

msgid "It uses QGIS as backend for the GIS logic and for map rendering. Furthermore the Qt library is used for graphics and for platform independent C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, the QGIS Server uses cartographic rules in SLD/SE as a configuration language, both for the server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic rules."

msgid "Moreover, the QGIS Server project provides the 'Publish to Web' plugin, a plugin for QGIS desktop which exports the current layers and symbology as a web project for QGIS Server (containing cartographic visualization rules expressed in SLD)."
msgstr ""

# 0d96dc5bdedb4e72a0abd9037db8c279
msgid "As QGIS desktop and QGIS Server use the same visualization libraries, the maps that are published on the web look the same as in desktop GIS. The Publish to Web plugin currently supports basic symbolization, with more complex cartographic visualization rules introduced manually. As the configuration is performed with the SLD standard and its documented extensions, there is only one standardised language to learn, which greatly simplifies the complexity of creating maps for the Web."
