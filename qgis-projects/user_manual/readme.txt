This folder will contain the qgis projects used to create the user manual documentation.

It can be used to create localized screenshots during translation and ofcourse for the next upgrade of the user manual.

Make sure the repository of QGIS-Documentation and qgis_sample_data have the same 
common root folder, otherwise the qgis projects will not be able to find the sourcefiles 
for the map layers.
