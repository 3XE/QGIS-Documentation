QGIS is a mature (started by `Gary Sherman <http://geoapt.com/>`_
in 2002!), user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS)
licensed under the GNU General Public License. You can use the software
provided by this project to create, visualize, analyze and share geospatial
data. QGIS is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) published under the
`GPL V2 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_ or greater license. As
such it is completely Free to use (see the download link below to download your
free copy) - you can share it with others and adapt and modify according to
your needs.

QGIS is the product of the hard work of many dedicated contributors who have
written documentation, translated text, filed bugs, drawn icons,
helped other users, built this web site and of course, written lots of
C++ and Python code! These contributors have donated their time and energy
in order to realise the vision of building a great, free GIS for everyone. We
are also the beneficiaries of financial support and sponsored development from
many contributors - companies big and small, local and national governments and
international agencies who all realise that they can capitalise on the
platform we provide and give something back to the project. They provide
benefit by making it better for everyone while at the same time reducing the
funds they would have otherwise allocated to purchasing expensive proprietary
GIS software.

QGIS is an official project of the `Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo)
<http://osgeo.org/>`_. It runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, Windows and Android
and supports many vector and raster data formats. QGIS is built on top of
many other great FOSS projects including `Qt <http://qt-project.org/>`_,
`GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`_, `PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`_,
`Proj4 <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/>`_, `Spatialite
<http://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/>`_
and many others.
