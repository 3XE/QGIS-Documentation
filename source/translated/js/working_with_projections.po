msgid "QGIS allows users to define a global and project-wide CRS (Coordinate Reference System) for layers without a pre-defined CRS. It also allows the user to define custom coordinate reference systems and supports on-the-fly (OTF) projection of vector and raster layers. All these features allow the user to display layers with different CRS and have them overlay properly."

msgid "QGIS has support for approximately 2,700 known CRS. Definitions for each of these CRS are stored in a SQLite database that is installed with QGIS. Normally you do not need to manipulate the database directly. In fact, doing so may cause projection support to fail. Custom CRS are stored in a user database. See Section :ref:`sec:customprojections` for information on managing your custom coordinate reference systems."

EPSG identifiers are present in the database and can be used to specify a CRS in QGIS."

msgid "In order to use OTF projection, your data must contain information about its coordinate reference system or you have to define a global, layer or project-wide CRS. For PostGIS layers QGIS uses the spatial reference identifier that was specified when the layer was created. For data supported by OGR, QGIS relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying the CRS. In the case of shapefiles, this means a file containing the Well Known Text (WKT):index:`WKT` specification of the CRS. This projection file has the same base name as the shapefile and a prj extension. For example, a shapefile named :file:`alaska.shp` would have a corresponding projection file named :file:`alaska.prj`."
